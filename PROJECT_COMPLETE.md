## 🧮 Key Business Logic

### Payment Calculation
```
if Card Payment AND Amount ≥ LKR 20,000:
    Final Amount = Amount × 1.03 (add 3%)
Balance = Final Amount - Old Gold Value
```

### Wastage Calculation
```
Theoretical = Target Weight × Coefficient
Allowed = Final Metal Weight × Coefficient
Actual = Gold Given - Final Metal - Purity Balance
Status = Ideal | Low | Excess
```

### Inventory Update
```
After bill creation:
    Item quantity -= ordered amount
    Alert if quantity < 2
```
